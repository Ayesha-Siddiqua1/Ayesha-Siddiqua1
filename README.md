## 📂 Projects  
🔹 **[Survival Prediction](#)** – In this project a ML model is trained and tested to predict whether the person in titanic ship has survived or not. I used the Logistic Regression to train the model. You can also use Random Forest and compare the results.  
🔹 **[Credit Card Fraud Detection](#)** – In this project a ML model is trained and tested to detect whether a transaction is legit or fraud. I used the Logistic Regression to train the model. You can also use Random Forest and compare the results.  
🔹 **[Sales Prediction](#)** – In this prject a ML model is trained to predict the revenue in which mode(TV, Radio, NewsPaper) an ad has more sales. I used Linear Regression to train the model.
